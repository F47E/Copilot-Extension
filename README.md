# Copilot-Extension
This is just a simple extension that opens Microsoft Copilot into an iFrame

Start:
1. Download this repo as a ZIP archive.
2. Extract the repo into its own directory (only the files from here should be inside the directory).
3. Keep note of where the directory containing the files is.

After Download:
1. Open the Chrome Extensions menu in your Browser.
   - You can do this by typing "Chrome://extensions" into the URL and pressing ENTER
2. Once in the extensions menu, click the Developer Mode switch to activate it
3. If you did everything right so far, you should see a button that says "Load Unpacked"
   - Click on the "Load Unpacked" button
4. After clicking the button, select the directory where you put the extracted ZIP files.
5. If everything worked properly, the extension should appear and everything works!
